#### Here are situations where DP fails or is not suitable:

1. Overlapping Subproblems are Absent
DP relies on the problem having overlapping subproblems. If there are no such subproblems, memoization or tabulation won't save time. i.e--> Finding the Nth Prime Number

2. state space is too large
When the state space is too large, DP becomes infeasible due to high time or space complexity, even if the problem theoretically has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. i.e--> Game Theory Problems with Complex States:
E.g., solving chess or Go using DP.





#### Polynomial Dynamic Programming (DP) refers to dynamic programming problems that can be solved in polynomial time, i.e., their time complexity is of the form  O(n ^ k)  where k is a constant and n is the input size.

Examples of Polynomial DP Problems:
1. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) --> Time: O(2 ^ min(m, n)); Space: O(min(m, n))
2. Knapsack Problem (0/1)
3. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm



#### Applications of Divide and Conquer
1. Merge Sort
2. Binary Search
